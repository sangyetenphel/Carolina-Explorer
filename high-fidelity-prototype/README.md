# High-Fidelity Prototype (Milestone 3)

This milestone is demonstrated primarily through short demo videos to ensure
all interactions and navigation are clearly visible without requiring any
external accounts.

## Demo Videos (Primary Artifact)

Due to GitHub limitations, demo videos must be downloaded to view.

Please click **View raw** on the video file to download and play locally.

- Customer flow: customer-prototype/customer-demo.mp4
- Provider flow: provider-prototype/provider-demo.mp4

The videos demonstrate all required use cases, page navigation, and interactive
elements using placeholder data (UI-only, no backend).

## Figma Site (Reference Only)

A Figma Site was used to design the high-fidelity UI. The site is publicly
viewable; however, some interactive controls (e.g., the Figma "Play" button)
may prompt for a Figma account.
