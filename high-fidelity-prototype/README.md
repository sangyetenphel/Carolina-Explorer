# High-Fidelity Prototype (Milestone 3)

This milestone is demonstrated primarily through short demo videos to ensure
all interactions and navigation are clearly visible without requiring any
external accounts.

## Demo Videos (Primary)
- Customer flow: customer-prototype/customer-demo.mp4
- Provider flow: provider-prototype/provider-demo.mp4

The videos demonstrate all required use cases, page navigation, and interactive
elements using placeholder data (UI-only, no backend).

## Figma Site (Reference)
A Figma Site was used to design the high-fidelity UI. The site is publicly
viewable, but some interactive controls (e.g., the Figma "Play" button) may
prompt for a Figma account.
