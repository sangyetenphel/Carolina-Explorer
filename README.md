## Description 
> Carolina Express is a web-based tour discovery platform designed to help tourists and new residents explore North Carolina through curated, guided experiences.

The motivation for this app comes from the difficulty many visitors face when trying to organize and prioritize must-see locations across North Carolina. With so many historical, cultural, and scenic attractions, planning an efficient and meaningful trip can be overwhelming.

The goal of Carolina Express is to simplify this process by connecting tourists with local tour guides based on location, schedule, and budget. The app allows users to discover tours, request bookings, and share reviews, while enabling tour guides to manage their offerings and availability in one place.
