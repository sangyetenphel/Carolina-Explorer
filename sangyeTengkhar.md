## About Me
Hi, my name is Sangye Tengkhar. I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, originally from Kathmandu, Nepal, and of Tibetan background. I’m passionate about software development and problem-solving, and I enjoy building projects that combine both front-end and back-end technologies. My goal is to grow as a software engineer and create technology that makes a meaningful, real-world impact.

## My CSC340 Goals
In CSC 340, I hope to strengthen my understanding of software engineering principles and the full software development lifecycle. I want to improve my ability to design, develop, and maintain scalable, well-structured applications while working effectively in a team environment. This course will help me gain hands-on experience with real-world development practices such as version control, collaboration, and problem-solving, which will prepare me for future software engineering roles.
