# Ayusha Thapa

## Hello, I am Ayusha! I am from Nepal, but I grew up here in North Carolina. I am a Compunter Science student here at UNCG, but I also enjoy graphic designing. I am excited to be in this class and get to know everyone!

## In this class, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how real-world software projects are designed, built, and managed as a team. I also want to improve my collaboration and communication skills while learning how to develop software!
